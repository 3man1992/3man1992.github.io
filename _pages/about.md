I am a PhD candidate at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, in London, sponsored by the Wellcome Trust. My research focuses on computational neuroscience. I primarily build models that attempt to aid our understanding of the neural basis of natural goal encodings. For example, you're a mouse, you love to hide in shelters. How does your brain encode the “concept” of a shelter? And what does the mouse think about before escaping to that shelter? I also conduct large scale electrophysiological recording methods during awake behavior paradigms to this end.

Before my PhD, I was undertaking a masters in Neuroscience at University College London (UCL) focusing on the neural basis of reinforcement learning, I finished an MBA at the University of Edinburgh business school, worked in industry within software engineering for several years as a product manager and a software developer and other random stuff to keep busy. 

Outside of the lab I spend most of my time swimming, promising to my partner that we will get a cat whenever the time is right, thinking about how technology can interface with the nervous system to improve the lives of those with neurological diseases and otherwise enjoying the outdoors.
